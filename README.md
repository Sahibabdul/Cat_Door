# Cat_Door
Problem:
Neighbours cat likes to go into my grandmas house. Therefore add a neural network-based system, which recognizes if a cat fits a reference photo cat.

Concept:
Cat walks infront of a webcam, that is connected to a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. That checks if the movement in the captured frame fits to multiple reference photos (which can include multiple cats). If the network comes back with a positive, the door opens.
